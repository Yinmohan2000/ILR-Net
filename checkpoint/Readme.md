  Due to our subsequent work being based on this network code, we are currently unable to find the previous training weights. Therefore, we attempted to retrain this network and obtained two versions of training weights. After testing, their performance varies on different datasets, some of which may lead to color distortion and bias issues in the results, which may differ from our experimental images.
  
  Everyone can train the network themselves. If there are any questions you don't understand, please contact me promptly.
